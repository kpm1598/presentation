            <h1>Phishing Attack</h1>
            <p>
              Phishing is a scam where attackers pretend to be trusted sources, like banks, 
              other organizations to trick people into giving away personal information. 
              They usually use fake emails or websites to deceive victims into clicking on harmful links or sharing sensitive details.
               This stolen information is then used for stealing money or committing fraud.

              A malware attack involves malicious software being installed on a computer, 
              smartphone, or network without the user's consent. This software, known as malware,
               can harm the system in various ways, such as stealing sensitive information, corrupting files,
                or taking control of the device. Common types of malware include viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, and spyware.

              A Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack is a type of cyberattack
               where a hacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters the
                communication between two parties, such as a user and a website,
                 without either party knowing. The attacker positions themselves
                  between the user and the intended server, allowing them to eavesdrop on the conversation,
                   steal sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers, or inject malicious data.
                    MitM attacks can happen over public Wi-Fi networks or through compromised internet connections,
                     making it appear as though the victim is communicating directly with the trusted service.</b>
